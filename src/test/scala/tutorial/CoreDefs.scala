/**
 * CoreDefs adds support for statements (also called definitions).
 * 
 * There is no special support for reifying statements in virtualized Scala.
 * You can't virtualize the semi-colon, so to speak (in principle you could, but we don't).
 * 
 * Instead, statements in the domain program (values of type Def[T]) are embedded as Scala statements that
 * have a single side-effect (from the host language's point of view): 
 *   register a new definition in the current scope (the scope that represents a part of the domain program)
 *   
 * This side-effect is implemented by toAtom, which largely remains hidden from the user 
 * (both of the DSL framework and the DSL itself) by virtue of being an implicit conversion.
 * Thus, it is driven by type information: a statement is of type Def[T], but the virtualizing
 * methods are set up to return Exp[T]'s.
